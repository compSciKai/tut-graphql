# tut-graphql

The code in this project was written in conjunction with a (Linkedin Learning course)[https://www.linkedin.com/learning/graphql-essential-training/learn-graphql-essentials?u=67553266]

I wanted to learn this framework for a few reasons. One, being my interest in web development. Two, it is cross platform and simplifies querying data from many sources. And three, to hopefully implement this framework into a school project.

Different components of this tutorial ie. testing, routing, components, were created in separate branches.
